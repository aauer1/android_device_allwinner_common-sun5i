/* The projob struct. 
 * Holds all relevant data for a projob
 *
 * A projob carries a set of drawcalls, each needing to be flushed
 * before the normal job is executed. The max number of drawcalls 
 * you can fit into a screen is technically 4096x4096 if each drawcall 
 * is to cover a pixel on its own. I've settled for a limit of 16x16 
 * - that is one tile. This simplifies the setup code slightly as 
 * we only need to start one tile worth of rendering. Increasing 
 * PROJOB_DRAWCALL_LIMIT beyond one tile will require some 
 * setup changes below, but it's not too hard. 
 *
 * We do not want a limit of the number of projob drawcalls you can add 
 * to a frame though, as that effectively limits the number of drawcalls 
 * in a frame. To avoid this limit, we may need to set up several HW jobs
 * to cover all the projob drawcalls needed. 
 *
 * The projob structure holds an ever-expanding set of projob HW jobs, 
 * where one is the "current" one. As we fill up a projob, we leave said HW 
 * job in the array of unflushed HW jobs, and just work on filling up the
 * next one. 
 *
 * When we actually flush the HW job, we flush the entire array of 
 * outstanding projobs. Due to how the HW job structures work, by flushing them
 * you are actually giving them over to the base subsystem. After flushing,
 * their pointers are invalid, and you can/should never touch them again. 
 * Effectively, from this module's point of view, flushing the array of HW 
 * jobs means deleting them. 
 *
